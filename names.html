    <h2><p>Jolteon</p>
 <p>Jolteon is a quadruped mammalian Pokémon, covered in spiny bright yellow fur. It has long ears resembling a rabbit, deep purple almond-shaped eyes, and a blunt catlike muzzle with a small black triangular nose. It has a spiky white mane encircling its neck. Its legs and paws are slender, with three toes on each and no visible claws. Jolteon has a spiny fringe of fur covering its backside, and it has a small short spike-like tail that is not often visible (but seen in games such as Pokémon Stadium). Its back legs seems to be powerfully-built, allowing it to run at high speeds like a cheetah.

        When shiny, Jolteon's yellow fur is green. The rest of its body remains normal.</p></h2>
